# 🧠 Open Code Mission (OCM)

**Built to Remember. Designed to Evolve.**

Open Code Mission is your AI memory engine—purpose-built for a new era of transparency, traceability, and user sovereignty. In a world tired of black-box systems and silent surveillance, OCM offers verifiable intelligence, memory-first AI, and compliance-ready architecture.  

**🚀 Beta Launch: December 15, 2025 – [Join the Waitlist »](https://ocmxai.com)**

## 🌍 Why Now?

- **💸 €35M fines | 63% ad-block adoption | One runaway chatbot later...**
  Regulators and users demand receipts. OCM prints them.

- **📍 Regional Compliance by Design**  
  Geo-fenced nodes + BYOK encryption = no cross-border data hops.  
  Compliant with **EU AI Act**, **Canadian AIDA**, and **U.S. AI Bill of Rights**.

- **🔐 Zero Surveillance**  
  No cookies. No server-side tracking. No silent observers.

## 🧬 Core Architecture

### 🧩 Capsule-Driven Memory System
> Like a USB stick for knowledge – versioned, cryptographically signed, and fully traceable.

- **MAG / MAC / MAL Stack**  
  Re-ranks memory in real-time. Sub-60ms recall after millions of vectors.

- **Verum Sphere**  
  Truth verification engine validating every fact via multi-source consensus and confidence scoring.

- **Memory Trinity**  
  Proprietary orchestration layer to secure memory integrity, learning efficiency, and attack resilience.
