#  Open Code Mission (OCM)

**Built to Remember. Designed to Evolve.**

Open Code Mission is your AI memory engine—purpose-built for a new era of transparency, traceability, and user sovereignty. In a world tired of black-box systems and silent surveillance, OCM offers verifiable intelligence, memory-first AI, and compliance-ready architecture.

## 🧬 Core Architecture

### 🧩 Capsule-Driven Memory System
> Like a USB stick for knowledge – versioned, cryptographically signed, and fully traceable.

- **MAG / MAC / MAL Stack**  
  Re-ranks memory in real-time. Sub-60ms recall after millions of vectors.

- **Verum Sphere**  
  Truth verification engine validating every fact via multi-source consensus and confidence scoring.

- **Memory Trinity**  
  Proprietary orchestration layer to secure memory integrity, learning efficiency, and attack resilience.
